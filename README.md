# OBS Google Calendar Script
OBS recently added python script integration so this script can be loaded in the tools->scripts menu once saved in the obs scripts folder.

Uses the Google Calendar API for updating for updating a specified text source or image source. Image folder must be specified in the user interface and the name of the image must match the google calendar event and be a .jpg

Documentation for using this script is on the OBS scripts page at the following link:
